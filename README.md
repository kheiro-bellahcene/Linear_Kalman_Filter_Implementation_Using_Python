## 📋 Summary

- 📈 The **Kalman filter estimation** (🔵 blue) converges effectively towards the **true vehicle state** (🔴 red).  
- 🎯 The **uncertainty ellipse** shrinks over time, indicating increasing precision in the estimates.  
- 📊 **Position and velocity errors** converge towards zero and remain within the ±3 sigma confidence interval, as shown in the second figure.  
- 🧮 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** at the end of the simulation:  
  - 📍 Position MSE: **27.65 m²**  
  - ⚡ Velocity MSE: **2.68 (m/s)²**  
- 🔍 **Innovation** (difference between prediction and measurement) is well-behaved:  
  - 📏 Standard deviations: **10.34 m (X)** and **11.16 m (Y)**  
  - ➖ Innovation mean ≈ **0**, indicating unbiased estimates.
